		<p class="about-ucf">
			This is being taught at an accelerated pace and the material builds on itself so it is recommended that you attend regularly unless you are super comfortable with a specific topic and donâ€™t want review/practice! However, you can go at your own pace and it is not at all uncommon to have people at different levels so we will work with you wherever you are!
