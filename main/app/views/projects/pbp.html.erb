We grow our food, compost, have an outdoor shower, and do lots of projects to build community locally. This spring EWBâ€™s project teams will be helping implement a rainwater harvesting system at the PBP! It will give our project teams the opportunity to work together, learn from each other and exercise team building on a project close to campus that someday we may have to implement in another country!
